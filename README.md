## Summary:

This document contains guidelines for web applications built by the Creative Technology (front end engineering) practice of Isobar 
North America (previously Molecular). It is to be readily available to anyone who wishes to check or contribute to the iterative 
progress of our discipline's best practices. 

This document's primary motivation is two- fold: 1) code consistency and 2) best practices. By maintaining consistency in coding 
styles and conventions, we can ease the burden of legacy code maintenance, and mitigate risk of breakage in the future. By adhering 
to best practices, we ensure optimized page loading, performance and maintainable code.

Code standards are living documents, and should themselves change to reflect the latest best practices, thought leadership, and trends both 
in the community whose practices they seek to standardize and in the greater development community as a whole. Front-end development 
is one of the fastest growing disciplines in software development; to ensure that our standards are able to keep pace, 
we want you to fork us, discuss additions, send us pull requests, and add issues to debate emerging standards and practices. 

We hope to encourage other developers to think about how to best standardize their approaches to development, to propose their own ideas for debate 
and for inclusion in our version of the document, and to adapt our standards for their own unique development practices. What better way of achieving consensus 
on how best to develop in our discipline than through feedback from members of that discipline themselves?
